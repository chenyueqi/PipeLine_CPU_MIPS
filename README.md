# PipeLine_CPU_MIPS
A complete pipeline based on mips instruction.
To adjust the design of pipeline cpu to possible general experiments. We added forwarding unit, control unit, cp0 and other necessary unit.
Moreover, to make the pipeline loaded evenly, we changed the original design and make something funciton units distributedly and work 
together in different phase to achieve the goals.
